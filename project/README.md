# The Finder
#### Video Demo:  <URL HERE>
#### Description:
The Finder is a web app that suggest movie or japanese anime.

On the home page you have two choice, go to **The Movie Finder** or **The Anime Finder**.

Click on one of them and you'll be redirected to the appropriate page.


Both of them have the same logic and have two ways of searching:

#### First search method:

On the left, there is the tag research:

- First, you must choice (via the select input) at least one "genre" tag, up to three.

- After that, you can choice (via the radio button input) the period of the movie/anime release. By default, "1990+" is selected.

- Last, you can choice the "rate" (via another radio button input) of the movie/anime you're looking for. By default, "0+" is selected.


#### Second search method:

On the right, there is the "reference" research:

- First, you must type (via the text input) the movie/anime that you want as reference.

- After that, you can choice (via the radio button input) the period of the movie/anime release. By default, "1990+" is selected.

- Last, you can choice the "rate" (via another radio button input) of the movie/anime you're looking for. By default, "0+" is selected.
